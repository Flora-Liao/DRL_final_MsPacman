# Training Q-learning and PPO Agents in the MsPacman-v5 Environment

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

To train the Q-learning in the paper, run this command:

```train
python DRL_final_code/code/Q/Q_train.py
```

To train the PPO in the paper, run this command:

```train
python DRL_final_code/code/PPO/PPO_train.py
```


## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ALE/MsPacman-v5, run:

```eval
# For Q-learning
python DRL_final_code/code/Q/Q_test.py

# For PPO
python DRL_final_code/code/PPO/PPO_test.py
```
